[MISSION WIN]
Good work. You kept our transports safe. They're what win wars, after all!
[MISSION FAIL]
While command understands that attacking enemy SSNs can be difficult, we are nevertheless disappointed you failed to protect our critical supply transports.
[MISSION MISSED]
Two-and-a-half hours ago, one of our supply convoys was completely decimated by a torpedo strike, sinking every transport and leaving few survivors. Command believes this was the work of the enemy sub you failed to intercept.
