[MISSION WIN]
Excellent work. It is good to hear about the violation of work in the oil and gas sector of the enemy.

[MISSION FAIL]
It's a pity that you couldn't complete the task. Enemy will continue to supply NATO forces with fuel, which will negatively affect the course of the war... 

[MISSION MISSED]
We are disappointed that you were not able to destroy the oil rig in the allotted time.
