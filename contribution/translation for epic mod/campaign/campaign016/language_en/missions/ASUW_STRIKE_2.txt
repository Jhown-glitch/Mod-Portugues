[MISSION WIN]
Great job! Russia will not forget you!
[MISSION FAIL]
We are extremely disappointed in your report. Because of your failure, our troops are stuck there due to lack of food and ammunition, some of whom had no choice but to surrender. Not to mention those who served on the supply ships that were sunken by this enemy group which you should have destroyed.
You are not worthy to be the commander of a warship! You are a shame for the motherland!
[MISSION MISSED]
We are saddened by your report. Now this strike group will keep threatening the supply of provisions and ammunition to our forces.
