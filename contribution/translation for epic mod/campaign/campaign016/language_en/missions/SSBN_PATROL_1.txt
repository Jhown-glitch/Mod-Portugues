According to the intelligence from a NATO port, the enemy is equipping submarines with ballistic missiles. In a few hours, they will be ready to leave the Naval Base near <color=Cyan><STARTLOCATION></color>, and in a few days they will most likely approach the Russian Far East to launch nuclear missiles to our key strategic sites.
