[MISSION WIN]
Congratulations on your brilliant work which ensure the safe movement of our convoys in the area.

A disappointing result. A complete paralysis of our traffic in the area is inevitable due to your failure in this mission.
[MISSION MISSED]
Your further work in this area is considered meaningless. The result of your inaction was not only the disruption of the stratigraphic-important transportation of our fleet in the area, but also the casualties on our part: about 10 ships, and about 500 people killed. How will you live with this next?
