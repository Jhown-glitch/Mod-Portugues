[MISSION WIN]
The commander of the submarine forces of the Northern Fleet of the Russian Federation was very happy to hear about your recent success, Commander. NATO must remember that the waters of the Pacific Ocean are ours, and any attempt to act in them will be decisively suppressed. The excellent work of you and your team is why you received this message! Well done!

[MISSION FAIL]
Your were not able to face the enemy submarine with all determination, which has made life on the shores of the Pacific for our colleagues much more difficult. Not to mention the danger to our merchant ships. We will have to work hard.

[MISSION MISSED]
Further search for the enemy is unproductive at this time
