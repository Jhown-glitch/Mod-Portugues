[MISSION WIN]
Great work in sinking these submarines, Commander! Your contribution to the war will make the transit of our convoys much safer - and thus support our troops on land - that's what the Navy is for! Carry on commander!
[MISSION FAIL]
Commander, your inability to solve the enemy underwater threat with determination will make life in the Pacific much more difficult for our colleagues. Not to mention a much more dangerous life for merchants.
[MISSION MISSED]
We are disappointed to hear that the mission cannot be carried out. Remember that time works for the enemy, not for us.
