Title=<b>WAR CRIMES INVESTIGATION</b>
Sentence1=Outrageous protests erupted after <FRIENDLY> accepted <ENEMY_SINGULAR>'s demands for a truce to deport and prosecute war criminals. Political scientists have dismissed the armistice agreement as a travesty and called it the "greatest betrayal" and the "darkest hour" in modern history.
Sentence2=Numerous <FRIENDLY_SINGULAR> officers have been named under the terms of the truce agreement and charged with their direct involvement and participation in war crimes. A leaked report reveals that <PLAYERNAME>, who served as commander of <PLAYERVESSELHULL> <PLAYERVESSELNAME> is among those already deported.
