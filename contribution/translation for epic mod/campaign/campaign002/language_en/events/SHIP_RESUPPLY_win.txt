Title=<b><ENEMY> FALLS BACK</b>|<b>SUPPORT IS OVER</b>
Color=57,61,73,255
Sentence1=A <ENEMY_NAVY_SINGULAR> Naval operation to re-supply its ships near <ENDLOCATION_RO> was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of a <FRIENDLY_NAVY_SINGULAR>. Despite the presence of an escort, the boat managed to strike at the support ships and leave unhindered before the approach of the patrol forces. The danger of a repeat of such attacks forced <ENEMY_NAVY> to withdraw the remaining supply ships from the dangerous area
Sentence2=A <ENEMY_SINGULAR> spokesman said that the situation is difficult, but not yet critical, because <ENEMY_NAVY> continues to rely on numerous bases in the North Atlantic, but the lack of the possibility of resupply at sea will inevitably lead to a decrease in their effectiveness.
