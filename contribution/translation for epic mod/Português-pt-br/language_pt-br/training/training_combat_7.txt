<b>Stealth</b>
With stealth you can strike the enemy and disappear before the they have a chance to react. Your best defense is not to be attacked at all!

<b>Silent Running</b>
<KEY:Silent Running> can be used to toggle silent running mode which reduces noise your vessel makes, but also:
1) stops all repairs
2) stops all pumping of water from flooded compartments
3) stops reloading of weapons
4) restricts speed to Ahead 1/3

Be sure Silent Running mode is disabled before moving on.

Use <KEY:Help> now to learn about maintaining stealth and avoiding counter-attack.

[TRAINING 2]
<b>Decoys</b>
A small torpedo that instead of an explosive warhead, generates noise very similar to your submarine.

Decoys are fired in the same manner as other torpedoes, however they have no tube settings and simply run along the direction specified.

Decoys work best when placed between your submarine and the enemy trying to detect you.
[/TRAINING 2]

[TRAINING 3]
<b>Noisemaker</b>
This device generates loud noise (hence the name) which blinds or jams the sonar guidance of a homing torpedo.

As with decoys, noisemakers are most effective when between your submarine and the incoming torpedo.

Use <KEY:Noisemaker> to deploy a noisemaker. There are limited noisemakers on board (see stores) and the launcher takes some time to reload.
The noisemaker will appear on your map.
[/TRAINING 3]

[TRAINING 4]
<b>Knuckle</b>
A knuckle is a mass of turbulent water which can be generated by putting the rudder hard over back and forth while at high speed (25 knots).
The knuckle distorts and scatters sound waves which can confuse the sonar guidance of a homing torpedo.

<b>Generating a knuckle</b>
1) Use <KEY:Increase Power> to set your speed to Ahead Flank.
2) When your submarine reaches 25 knots, put the rudder hard over (all the way) to the left or right.
3) Once the rudder has moved all the way, immediately put the rudder hard over (all the way) in the opposite direction.

If performed correctly, a knuckle is formed which briefly appears on your map and is confirmed by the message log.

Unlike noisemakers, a knuckle is not guaranteed to form and lasts significantly less time. They are only effective if formed between your submarine and the incoming torpedo.

<color=maroon>Reduce speed, run straight and level and be sure your depth is close to 150 ft before next step.</color>

[TRAINING 5]
<b>Damage Control</b>
Tubes and Bow Sonar have just been damaged!

Use <KEY:Damage Report> or <LEFTCLICK> the Damage Control tab in the bottom right to open the Damage Control panel.

Tubes are black: one or more tubes are critically damaged for the rest of the mission. In a campaign, repair at port is required.
Bow Sonar is offline and being repaired as indicated by the red text and red bar.

<LEFTCLICK> the Bow Sonar label to assign it as top priority for repair. The damage control party moves to the front compartment (spanner/wrench icon) and repairs Bow Sonar in half the time. After 30 seconds or so your Bow Sonar will be back online as verified by the message log.

Use <KEY:Help> now to learn more about damage control and the effects of subsystems being offline or destroyed.

<color=maroon>Reduce speed, run straight and level and be sure your depth is close to 150 ft before next step.</color>

[TRAINING 6]
<b>Flooding</b>
Engine room taking on water!

Watch as blue water fills up the engine room, causing your submarine to slowly sink.
(If it does not flood, you were too shallow and/or damage control party was in the compartment which stopped the flooding immediately)

As you reach 200 ft depth, <LEFTCLICK> Propulsion to assign damage control to that compartment. Propulsion is not damaged but the damage control party also reduces the flooding rate within their compartment and will pump the water out if you are shallow enough.

Use <KEY:Help> now to learn more about flooding, especially what determines the rate of flooding and how to reduce it.
Remember, working Pumps, damage control team, current depth, damage amount and number of damaged compartments are all crucial factors for controlling flooding.
[/TRAINING 6]

[TRAINING 7]
<b>Uncontrolled Flooding</b>
Machinery space taking on water!
Watch what happens as another compartment floods:
Your submarine slowly sinks and as it gets deeper, the water pressure increases the flooding rate.

As you get deeper, damage control party can no longer keep up and engine room flooding resumes as well.

Flooding is now uncontrollable, surface immediately!
Use <KEY:Ballast Up> to set ballast to 30.
Use <KEY:Planes Up> to set planes to 30 and use <KEY:Increase Power> to increase speed.

<b>Reminder: Emergency Blow</b>
If submarine doesn't respond, use <KEY:Blow Ballast>. Set your speed to Flank and dive planes to 30 in conjunction with blowing ballast to dramatically assist with the rate of surfacing.
Once on the surface, level out your planes.

<b>Repair Flooding</b>
Once surfaced (or very near the surface) flooding becomes more manageable and you can begin to reduce flooding by assigning the damage control party to any flooded compartments. However if you dive again, flooding can resume.

REMINDER: outside of training, you are unable to leave the combat area unless flooding has been brought under control.

<b>Surfacing a Flooded Submarine</b>
Flooding can make it difficult to surface properly.
Set ballast to maximum and/or blow emergency ballast.
If you still cannot surface, it might be time to abandon ship.
[/TRAINING 7]

[TRAINING 8]
<b>Losing Your Submarine</b>
Your submarine will be destroyed if hull integrity is reduced to 0% or by exceeding crush depth and imploding.
As hull integrity decreases, crush depth becomes more shallow, resulting in up to 50% reduction in crush depth.

If your submarine is destroyed, the combat interface is disabled.
Use <KEY:Cancel or Quit> to enter the mission menu and end the mission.

In the mission menu you may:
1) <LEFTCLICK> <DICTIONARY:AbandonShip>. If your sub is still intact and above escape depth you and your crew may survive yet by abandoning ship.
2) <LEFTCLICK> <DICTIONARY:ExitMission> to end this mission.

Either of these options will take you to the After Action Report.
When finished viewing the After Action Report, <LEFTCLICK> <DICTIONARY:Continue> or <KEY:Continue>.

Commander, your training is complete. Use <KEY:Help> to read the Help section on Tactics as it contains many tips for attacking enemies and evading weapons.

Use <KEY:Cancel or Quit> to leave when ready and good luck.
