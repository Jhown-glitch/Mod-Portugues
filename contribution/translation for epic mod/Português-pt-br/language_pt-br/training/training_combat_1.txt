If the exact position of a contact is not known, it is not displayed in the world. We will reveal the ship with the periscope during the next step.

Next use <KEY:Camera To Aircraft>. Freeze camera with <KEY:Still Camera>, then use <KEY:Still Camera> again to return to following.

<KEY:Event Camera> toggles the event camera on/off as indicated by the icon in upper right. The event camera will automatically focus on events of interest such as weapons firing and impacting.

<b>2) Place Waypoint</b>
Ensure your submarine is visible on the mini-map and use <KEY:Fire Tube> to set the waypoint. Bearing and Range to the waypoint are displayed and a blue line now appears on the mini-map which follows your mouse pointer.

Simply move your mouse pointer around the mini-map, placing it directly over the target, the readout bearing should display approximately 0.

<RIGHTCLICK> to set the waypoint and fire. Map can be panned, zoomed and centered while dragging a waypoint and if needed, use <KEY:Cancel or Quit> to cancel setting a waypoint.

If all went well, your torpedo should run north and strike the target.
If it misses or ship doesn't sink, fire another remembering to select a loaded tube and set the waypoint's bearing to 0.
