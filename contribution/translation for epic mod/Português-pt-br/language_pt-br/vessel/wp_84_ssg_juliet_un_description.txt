Description=Juliett Class SSG (1984)

History=These boats, built during the 1960's, are first-generation Soviet cruise missile boats, designed as cheaper diesel-electric equivalents of the Echo-class SSGN's. They also have to stay on the surface in order to target, launch and guide their SS-N-3 missiles, during which they are extremely vulnerable to NATO ASW.
