Description=Whiskey Long Bin Class SSG

History=Between 1960 and 1963, six Project 613 boats received an expanded hull that could contain four P-5 missiles. These upgraded submarines were called Whiskey Long Bin in the West and project 665 in the Soviet Union. The P-5 missiles could only be launched from the surface, which significantly limited the combat capabilities of the boat.
