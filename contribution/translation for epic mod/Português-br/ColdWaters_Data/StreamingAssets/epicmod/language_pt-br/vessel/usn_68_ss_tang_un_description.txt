ShipClass=Tang
Description=Tang Class SS (1968)
History=The Tang Class submarines were developed from the Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program (GUPPY) conversion program for World War II submarines, which incorporated stolen German Type XXI U-boat technology into the United States Navy's submarine design. They comprised the state of the art in post-World War II conventionally powered submarine design; some of their features were incorporated into the nuclear-powered submarines that replaced them in the 1950s and beyond.
