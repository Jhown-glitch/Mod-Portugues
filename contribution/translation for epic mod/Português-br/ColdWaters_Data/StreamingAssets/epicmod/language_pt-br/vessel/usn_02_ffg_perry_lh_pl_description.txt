Description=Perry Class Long Hull Anti-Submarine Ship (2002)
Aircraft=2 SH-60F Seahawk

History=The Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate ships were produced in 445-foot (136 m) long "short-hull" (Flight I) and 453-foot (138 m) long "long-hull" (Flight III) variants. Both were designed primarily as anti-aircraft and anti-submarine warfare guided-missile warships intended to provide open-ocean escort of amphibious warfare ships and merchant ship convoys in moderate threat environments in a potential war with the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact countries, with long-hulled warships carrying the larger and more-capable SH-60 Seahawk LAMPS III helicopters. They could also provide air defense against and anti-ship missiles. These warships are equipped to escort and protect aircraft carrier battle groups, amphibious landing groups, underway replenishment groups, and merchant ship convoys. This ship received the Mark 50 Torpedo.
