WeaponDescription=The R-27U (NATO: SS-N-6 Mod2) - The resolution of the Council of Ministers on the modernization of the D-5 complex was issued on June 10, 1971. The goal was to create two versions of the modernized rocket. The first option provided for equipping the missile with a warhead with three warheads, while maintaining the maximum firing range. The head part is of the “scattering” type, with blocks without individual guidance. The second option provided for increasing the range and increasing the accuracy of the missile. The modernized version of the complex was designated D-5U, and the missiles - R-27U. A missile was created with three warheads with a capacity of 200 kt each with a maximum range of 2400 km. The multiple warhead was of the so-called “scattering type” - the warheads did not have individual guidance. At the end of the active section, the blocks were “pushed” in different directions at low speed. According to the second option, a missile with a range of 3000 km and a monoblock warhead with a power of 1 Mt was created. A CEP of 1.3 km was achieved. The modernization affected the engine (thrust was increased) and the control system. In the west, the missiles were designated SS-N-6 Mod 3 and Mod 2, respectively. Ship tests of R-27U missiles took place from September 1972 to August 1973. 16 launches were carried out, all considered successful. The R-27U missile was adopted for service on January 4, 1974 by resolution of the Council of Ministers No. 8-5. The D-5U complex with R-27U missiles was equipped with Project 667AU nuclear-powered missile submarines under construction, as well as Project 667A boats after modernization.
