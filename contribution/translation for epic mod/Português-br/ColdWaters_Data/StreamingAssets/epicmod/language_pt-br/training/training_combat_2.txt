[TRAINING 1]=6
<b>Wire Guided Torpedoes</b>
Use <KEY:Help> now to read about torpedo settings and wire-guiding.

Let's practice:
Use <KEY:Tactical Map> to switch to full screen map.
Use <KEY:Fire Tube> and drag mouse to set waypoint approximately:
Bearing: 0 Range: 2 KYD
<RIGHTCLICK> to place waypoint and fire.

Third column above mini-map shows this wire-guided torpedo's data:
<b>WPN DATA</b> Wire/Tube Number
<b>CSE</b> Course
<b>RNG</b> Range
<b>BRG</b> Bearing - direction from your submarine to the weapon
<b>RTE</b> Range To Enable - distance from weapon to its waypoint
<b>TTR</b> Time To Run - time left for weapon to run

Note the "1" next to the torpedo icon on the tactical map, this is the tube/wire number.
[/TRAINING 1]

[TRAINING 2]
<b>Move Waypoint</b>
<i>If torpedo 1 reached its waypoint and is already active:
Fire another torpedo at Bearing:0 Range: 10 KYD</i>

<LEFTCLICK> to pick up the waypoint (may need to zoom map if other icons are nearby).
Drag waypoint about with mouse pointer, say to:
Bearing 30, Range 2 KYD.
<RIGHTCLICK> to place waypoint as new position (or use <KEY:Cancel or Quit> to cancel move).
Torpedo heads to this updated waypoint position.

Once the torpedo reaches its waypoint it:
- becomes enabled and starts searching for a target
- now uses the sensor, search and depth settings provided
- can no longer have its waypoint moved
- can be steered directly
[TRAINING 2]

[TRAINING 3]
<b>Steer Torpedo</b>
Once torpedo has reached its waypoint and is enabled:
Use <KEY:Steer Torpedo Left> and <KEY:Steer Torpedo Right> to change direction. Torpedo will continue straight unless tube setting is used to set another search pattern.

Use <KEY:Steer Torpedo Shallow> and <KEY:Steer Torpedo Deep> to change depth. Depth can also be adjusted by setting the tube's setting to RUN LEVEL, RUN SHALLOW or RUN DEEP. <i>Opening the Conditions Tab with <KEY:Conditions> will show current depth of the torpedo.</i>

<b>Other Torpedo Actions</b>
<KEY:Activate Torpedo> will activate a torpedo as if it had reached its waypoint.
<KEY:Cut Wire> cuts the wire, preventing further external control (disabled during training).

Wire guided torpedoes will not home on friendly vessels, but one with a cut or broken wire can!
[/TRAINING 3]

[TRAINING 4]
<b>Wire Breakage</b>
Disabled for training purposes, however a wire may be broken unintentionally with the same effect as cutting the wire.

Use <KEY:Help> now to read about the conditions causing wire breakage and how to avoid it.
[/TRAINING 4]

[TRAINING 5]
<b>Target Practice</b>
Be sure the camera is following one of your torpedoes (use <KEY:Camera To Weapon> or <LEFTCLICK> torpedo icon on map/mini map.

Use <KEY:Activate Torpedo> to enable the torpedo if it is not already active.
Using tube settings and/or direct steering, point your torpedo at one of the target ships. Once in range, your torpedo should "lock on" and home in to the target.

Try sinking the other targets. Use <KEY:Load Tube> to reload more torpedoes if needed.

Torpedoes can also be guided using the map, however this usually requires enough data to accurately plot the target's position. A subject to be examined in mission #5.

[TRAINING 6]
<b>Ending Combat</b>
To leave combat use <KEY:Cancel or Quit> to enter the mission menu and end the mission (auto hides this panel).

Once in the mission menu <LEFTCLICK> <DICTIONARY:ExitMission> to end this mission and view the After Action Report.

When finished viewing the After Action Report, <LEFTCLICK> <DICTIONARY:Continue> or <KEY:Continue>.
