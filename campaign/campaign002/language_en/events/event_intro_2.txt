Title=<b>SUPPRESSING THE UPRISING <n> IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA</b>
Color=57,61,73,255
Sentence1=In Eastern Europe, the USSR suppresses the democratic uprising in Czechoslovakia. The Presidium of the CPC urgently gathered in A. Dubcek's office, where they adopted a statement condemning Soviet actions and calling for refraining from resistance to Soviet troops. However, already at 4 o'clock in the morning, members of the government were captured by Soviet paratroopers, thus losing power. Later they were exported to the USSR.

Sentence2=By the end of August 21, the troops of the Warsaw Pact countries were able to capture all the main points of Czechoslovakia, thereby carrying out the main part of Operation Danube. Such a rapid advance of troops across the country is explained by the almost complete absence of resistance from the Czechoslovak army and the fact that NATO countries did not intervene in this conflict in any way, which was also quite reasonable. The destabilization of the situation in the center of Europe at that time was not needed by anyone, and the American leadership, tied up in Vietnam, did not have any instruments of influence here.
