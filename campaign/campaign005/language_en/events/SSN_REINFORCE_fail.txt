Sentence1=Several US operations have suffered from attacks by enemy submarines in <ENDLOCATION>. According to anonymous sources, a squadron of Russian state-of-the-art submarines have successfully eluded the US Navy's anti-submarine barriers and are now operating on behalf of China. The Kremlin has so far refused to answer to what they called 'unsubstantiated allegations'.
Color=218,218,208,255
Sentence2=As attacks mount, US naval operations have been curtailed for the time being until adequate countermeasures can be implemented. If these efforts fail to produce results, the outcome could be dire for the United States and its regional allies.
