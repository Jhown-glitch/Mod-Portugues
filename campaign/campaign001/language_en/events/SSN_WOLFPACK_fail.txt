Title=<b><ENEMY> STRIKES</b>|<b>STRIKE FROM THE DEEP</b>|<b>SEA PREDATORS</b>
Color=57,61,73,255
Sentence1=Several American supply ships were victims of missile strikes in the area of <ENDLOCATION_RO>. With this attack, the <ENEMY_NAVY> disrupted the operation of the <FRIENDLY_NAVY_SINGULAR> to deliver fuel and ammunition to its warships at sea. A large number of sailors died or went missing. Bad weather in the region hinders rescue efforts.
Color=218,218,208,255
Sentence2=The representative of the General Staff acknowledged that the situation is very serious. Quote: "<ENEMY_NAVY_SINGULAR> missile submarines act with complete impunity and their attacks call into question the possibility of ensuring the actions of our warships in the far zone. Unfortunately, all attempts to thwart their actions have failed."
