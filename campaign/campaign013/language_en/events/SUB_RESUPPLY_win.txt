Color=57,61,73,255
Sentence1=The NATO Navy's operation to supply its submarines near <ENDLOCATION_RO> was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of a Soviet submarine. Despite the presence of an escort, the boat managed to strike at the support ships and leave unhindered before the approach of the patrol forces. The danger of a repeat of such attacks forced the NATO Navy to withdraw the remaining supply ships from the dangerous area
Sentence2=The NATO spokesman said that the situation is difficult, but not yet critical, because the NATO Navy continues to rely on numerous bases in the North Atlantic, but the lack of the possibility of resupply at sea will inevitably lead to a decrease in their effectiveness.
