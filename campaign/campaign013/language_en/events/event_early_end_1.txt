Title=<b>CRITICAL LOSS</b>
Sentence1=The <FRIENDLY_NAVY>s have suffered heavy casualties in recent encounters with the <ENEMY_NAVY_SUFFIX> and seem to be forced to cease active operations and focus solely on defending their bases.

Sentence2=Meanwhile, <FRIENDLY_NAVY_SINGULAR> failures at sea are already having an impact on the course of the war on land. Several strike groups and <ENEMY_NAVY_SINGULAR> aircraft carriers provide active support to the defending forces, which were able not only to breathe more freely, but also to launch a counteroffensive in several sectors of the front.
