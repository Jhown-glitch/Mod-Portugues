WeaponDescriptiveName=SS-N-14 URPK-3 "Metel' ASW Missile
WeaponDescription=URPK-3 "Metel' (NATO classification: SS-N-14 Silex) is a subsonic ASW missile equipped on most Soviet large anti-submarine ships as well as the frigates of the Krivak class. It can be launched to the first convergence zone, and drops an AT-2 homing torpedo. Because it has a larger range than the effective range of the surface ship sonar, it can use targeting data transmitted from any friendly sea or air unit via datalink.
