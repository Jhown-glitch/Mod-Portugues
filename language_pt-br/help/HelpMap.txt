<size=24><color=maroon><b>TACTICAL MAP</b></color></size>
The Tactical Map, and associated Mini-Map, provides an overview of the battle based on your submarine's sensor data. This data is crucial to maintain situational awareness and stay in control of a battle as it unfolds. In addition, the Tactical Map is linked to your submarine's weapon systems to provide targeting information.

<b>USING THE MAP</b>
Note that when using the mini-map, mouse pointer must be over it in order to use pan and zoom.
<b>Pan Map:</b> <LEFTCLICK> and drag the mouse.
<b>Zoom Map:</b> <MOUSEWHEEL> or <KEY:Zoom In> and <KEY:Zoom Out>.
<b>Centre Map:</b> <KEY:Centre Map> will place your submarine in the center of the map.
<b>Auto-Centre Map:</b> <KEY:Auto Centre Map> locks the map to your submarine.
<b>Maximise Map:</b> <KEY:Tactical Map> toggles between mini-map and full screen map. Auto hides mini-map when switching to full screen.
<b>Hide Mini-Map:</b> <LEFTCLICK> in upper portion of the mini-map hides/restores it. If you lose your submarine from mini-map, maximize map, drag your submarine to the center, then minimize map.

The grid scale of the tactical map is shown in the upper right when in full screen mode.

Icons displayed on the map are as follows and are described in further detail below:
















<b>VESSEL POSITIONS</b>
The map displays your submarine position and trail which is always 100% accurate. <LEFTCLICK> on your submarine will move the camera to it.

Contacts are displayed based on their current target solution, namely how accurately their speed, course and range have been determined. The better the solution, (closer to 100%) the more accurate will be the displayed position of that contact. Once course is known, the icon will change so as to display that course and once the solution is at a high enough level of confidence, that contact will be updated more frequently on the map as well as have a trail showing where it has travelled. The process of building up information about a contact is termed Target Motion Analysis and is explained in more detail below.

<LEFTCLICK> on a contact will either;
1) select that contact.
2) if already selected, move camera to that contact.

<b>TORPEDOES</b>
If your sensors can detect a torpedo, it will be displayed on the map along with its trail. Player fired torpedoes on a wire or straight running torpedoes are always displayed since their position does not require detection by your sensors.

<LEFTCLICK> on a torpedo will either;
1) select that torpedo for weapon guidance (if friendly and on a wire).
2) move camera to that torpedo.

<b>WEAPON WAYPOINTS</b>
When firing a weapon, a waypoint must be set. Simply <RIGHTCLICK> to place the waypoint at the current mouse position over the map. To edit a waypoint, <LEFTCLICK> to pick it up and <RIGHTCLICK> to place it at the current mouse position. Only weapons on an active wire may have their waypoint edited if they have not yet reached their waypoint and become activated.

<b>WEAPON LEAD INDICATOR</b>
When firing torpedoes, a lead indicator appears in front of the target to show the intercept point for that weapon. This can be used to assist with setting your waypoint. Lead indicator is only shown if the target solution is at maximum.

<b>NOISEMAKERS AND KNUCKLES</b>
Countermeasures dropped by vessels or disturbances in the water induced by putting the rudder hard to one side at high speeds (a knuckle) are also indicated on the Tactical Map. These interfere with torpedo homing.

<b>DIRECTIONAL INDICATORS</b>
Active sonar pings that your submarine can hear are displayed as a line from your submarine in the direction the ping was heard from. Such pings from other vessels or active sonobuoys dropped by aircraft and are displayed in yellow. Pings from terminal homing active torpedoes (friendly or enemy) are displayed in red. Whenever your ESM mast is extended, radar emissions from vessels or aircraft are displayed in a similar way to indicate the direction of the emitting source. These indicators are shown in purple.

<b>AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES</b>
Airborne objects are not shown on the Tactical Map.

<b>ICE and MINES</b>
As ice and mines are detected by your high frequency navigation sonar, they are mapped onto the tactical map. Ice may also be mapped by marking it with the periscope, see Sensors, Periscope section for more information.

<b>PORT</b>
Shows the location of ports.

<b>DEPLOYMENT ZONE</b>
Circular area used for Insertion missions to deploy special forces or in Land Strike missions to fire land attack missiles into.

<b>MAP BOUNDARY</b>
Near the outside of the map is a red shaded boundary which demarcate the limit of the combat zone. While it is possible for other vessels, aircraft or weapons to move into this region, navigating your submarine here immediately ends combat. Ending combat in this manner does not require breaking contact with the enemy.


<size=24><color=maroon><b>CONTACTS</b></color></size>
Contacts are sound sources, usually vessels, detected by your sensors. The second data column above the mini-map displays information about the current contact.
<b>CONTACT NAME</b> The name or designation of the contact
<b>BRG</b> Bearing - direction from your submarine to the contact
<b>CSE</b> Contact's course
<b>SPD</b> Contact's speed
<b>RNG</b> Range to contact
<b>SOL</b> Target Solution quality, namely how accurate information about the contact is

For a given contact, the position and amount of detail plotted on the tactical map is based on the target solution confidence.


<size=24><color=maroon><b>TARGET MOTION ANALYSIS (TMA)</b></color></size>
TMA is the observation of a contact over time to build up information about its course, speed and range. This accumulated data is called the target solution and as mentioned above, calculating an accurate target solution accurately plots a contact's position and movement on the Tactical Map. With an accurate target solution you have a much better chance to hit with weapons and knowing when you might be risking detection by straying into enemy sensor range.

Rate of Target Solution Accuracy Increases with:
- Selecting a contact as your current contact
- Stronger signal detected from the contact.
- Knowing the type of contact you are tracking, see Signature Analysis.
- High rate of bearing change over time to contact.
- Accurately ranging the contact using active sonar, laser (marking the target with periscope) or radar.

Rate of Target Solution Accuracy Decreases with:
- Weaker signal coming from the contact.
- An unclassified or incorrectly classified contact.
- Changes in contact course or speed.
- Losing contact with the target.
- Low rate of bearing change over time to contact.
- Contact firing a decoy torpedo.

TMA is automatically performed by your crew as long as the contact is maintained. Losing a contact results in decay of the target solution over time as the data becomes less relevant to where that contact might actually be now.

Detection and analysis of a contact is based on your submarine's sensors which are described in detail in the Sensors section.


<size=24><color=maroon><b>SIGNATURE ANALYSIS</b></color></size>
Passive sonar signals from a contact can be compared to known sound profiles of various vessels in order to identify the class of ship you are tracking, a process termed signature analysis. Over time, your crew will automatically perform this task however a skilled commander can speed up the process. The sooner a contact has been correctly classified, less time TMA will take and the quicker you can identify threats and prioritise targets. Note that a contact may also be classified by raising the periscope, establishing visual contact and marking that target (see Sensors, Periscope section for more information).
















Use <KEY:Signature> or click on the Signature tab in the bottom right to open the Signature Panel and view the current contact's sound profile (lower panel). The upper panel contains a database of known vessel profiles for comparison. Following the vessel name is the designation for that type of vessel, see Reference section for a list of ship designations.

Use <KEY:Context Menu Next> and <KEY:Context Menu Previous> to cycle through the various profile signatures until the lines (sound frequency peaks) between the two profiles correspond.  Finally use <KEY:Context Menu Set> to classify the contact as the class you've identified when confident the profiles are a match. Alternatively you may <LEFTCLICK> the arrows or checkbox.

If the classification is correct, TMA rate will increase, however if incorrect it will suffer a penalty. Your crew will eventually remedy an incorrectly classified contact, but valuable time will have been lost or you might be attacking the wrong target.

Sound profile for the contact is susceptible to flow noise, such that increasing speed increases background noise, making it more difficult to resolve the finer details of the profile and determine a correct match.

The Signature Analysis panel also contains additional information about your ownship and contact sensors.
"SIG STR OWNSHIP" is the signal strength of your ownship's various sensors. It lists the intensity of the sound detected in decibels for your active, passive and towed array (if applicable) sonar.

Likewise "SNS COMP" (sensor comparison) is comparison of the contact's various sensors. Again it lists active, passive and towed array (if applicable) intensity. This information can be crucial to determine how close you might be to being detected by the enemy. However if the contact has yet to be classified, this information is not available. Worse still, if the contact is incorrectly classified you might be looking at the wrong vessel's sensor data.

Negative values are theoretical calculations based on current noise levels and range for the current ocean conditions.


<size=24><color=maroon><b>RECOGNITION MANUAL</b></color></size>
















When attempting to classify a contact or while visually spotting with the periscope, the recognition manual offers in-depth information about the capabilities of the various units in the game. You open it by using M or by clicking the ship icon in the upper right portion of the screen. It is cross-linked with the Signature Analysis window so that cycling through profiles in one also updates the other. Clicking on the weapons and sensors in red opens a text window with more in-depth information about them. Use this information to establish whether or not the selected contact is a threat to you.
