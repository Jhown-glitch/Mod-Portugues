Description=Victor III-class SSN (1984)

History=These boats represent the ultimate evolution of the Victor-class submarine. They were the first boats to be given a towed array, and they were the first to be built with improved quieting features such as raft-mounted machinery. Originally designed with an offset tandem propeller, they have since been upgraded with reduced-cavitation propellers. The entire group are also fitted with fire control for the SS-N-16 standoff ASW missile.
