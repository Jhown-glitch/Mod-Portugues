Description=Typhoon Class SSBN

History=Dmitry Donskoy is the last remaining Typhoon class submarine in service. It is the fastest of all the ships in the series; it's two knots faster than the previous speed record for its class. The Donsky's weapons, sonar, quiteing, and even SLBMs are all modernized; it is also the largest of the Typhoons. This is due to the fact that the RSM56 (SS-N-32 Bulava) SLBMs which it has been outfitted to test are larger than the SS-N-20 Sturgeons of the other boats of Project 941.
