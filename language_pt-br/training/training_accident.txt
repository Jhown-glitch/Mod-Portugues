<b>Submarine Lost</b>
Your submarine has been destroyed.
Thankfully this was only a training simulation.

Upon destruction, the HUD is disabled.
Use <KEY:Cancel or Quit> to enter the mission menu and end the mission.

In the mission menu you may:
1) <LEFTCLICK> <DICTIONARY:AbandonShip>. If your ship is intact and above escape depth you and your crew may survive yet, otherwise nothing happens.
2) <LEFTCLICK> <DICTIONARY:Quit> to end this mission.

Either of these options will take you to the After Action Report.
When finished viewing the After Action Report, <LEFTCLICK> <DICTIONARY:Continue> or <KEY:Continue>.
