<b>Data Panel - Ownship</b>
Above the mini-map is the Data Panel which contains 3 columns of data (left to right).
1) Ownship data
2) Contact Data
3) Weapon data (torpedo on a wire)

For this mission we'll just focus on the first column which displays your vessel's;
<b>CSE</b> Course
<b>SPD</b> Speed
<b>DEP</b> Depth
<b>RUD</b> Rudder
<b>PLN</b> Planes
<b>BAL</b> Ballast

As you adjust your submarine's rudder, planes and ballast, the settings will be displayed here as will your submarine's current course, speed and depth.
[/TRAINING 1]

[TRAINING 2]
<b>Speed and Steering</b>
<b>Speed</b>
Use <KEY:Increase Power> and <KEY:Decrease Power> to adjust your speed.
Message log at bottom right shows your current speed setting.
Now use <KEY:Increase Power> to bring your speed up to Ahead Flank.

<b>Steering</b>
Use <KEY:Rudder Left> and <KEY:Rudder Right> to steer your vessel.
Rudder is set in 5 degree increments to a minimum of -30 degrees (left) and +30 degrees (right).
Now use <KEY:Rudder Left> to bring your rudder hard over to -30 degrees port.

Your submarine should now be turning in a circle, note the Data Panel's left-most column reflecting your changing course and current rudder setting.

[TRAINING 3]
<b>Depth Control</b>
<color=red><b><i>WARNING: Commander, you are expected to navigate your vessel safely and are not to exceed 1000 ft depth</i></b></color>

Dive Planes: Use <KEY:Planes Down> and <KEY:Planes Up> change depth with dive planes.
Planes are set in 5 degree increments to a minimum of -30 degrees (down) and +30 degrees (up) and require some forward movement to function.
Set your planes back to 0 in order to level out.

Ballast: Use <KEY:Ballast Down> and <KEY:Ballast Up> change depth using ballast.
Ballast is set in 5 unit increments to a minimum of -30 (down) and +30 (up) and does not require any forward movement to function.
Depth changes with ballast are much slower than with planes.

<b>Straight & Level</b>
Use <KEY:Level Submarine> to quickly set rudder, planes and ballast settings to 0.

<b>Holding Navigation Keys</b>
Rather than tapping keys to change rudder, planes, ballast and speed, you may hold then release at the desired setting.

[TRAINING 4]
<b>Emergency Blow</b>
Experiment with navigating your submarine as well as changing depth and speed. Be sure not to exceed 1000 ft depth.

When ready, take your submarine down to about 200 ft depth and level it out.

<b>Emergency Blow</b>
In an emergency situation you can use <KEY:Blow Ballast> to blow emergency ballast in order to surface as quickly as possible.

Use <KEY:Blow Ballast> now. Set your speed to Flank and dive planes to 30 in conjunction with blowing ballast to dramatically assist with the rate of surfacing.

Once on the surface, level out your planes.
[/TRAINING 4]

[TRAINING 5]
<b>Compressed Air</b>
Blowing emergency ballast depletes reserves of compressed air. Once on the surface, air is available to replenish these reserves, but it takes time.

Gradually the ballast indicator will count down to 0 at which time the compressed air is replenished and your submarine is able to dive again and use emergency ballast once more.

Note that from the time of blowing emergency ballast until compressed air reserves are restored, ballast settings cannot be changed.

[TRAINING 6]
<b>Ending Combat</b>
To leave combat use <KEY:Cancel or Quit> to enter the mission menu and end the mission (auto hides this panel).

Once in the mission menu <LEFTCLICK> <DICTIONARY:ExitMission> to end this mission and view the After Action Report.

When finished viewing the After Action Report, <LEFTCLICK> <DICTIONARY:Continue> or <KEY:Continue>.
