The most important improvement is that AN/APS-115 is an automatic version of earlier AN/APS-80/80A, but some users felt that in the hands of an experienced operator, the manual analog AN/APS-80/80A has a better chance to detect small targets such as submarine periscope in sea clutter. AN/APS-115 utilizes cavity magnetron.
usn_aps-124=APS-124=Knowledge gained in the development of AN/APS-115/116 is used in the development of X-band AN/APS-124, the first model in the radar family developed for ASW helicopters. Due to the adoption of the traveling wave tube (TWT), the peak power is significantly increased to 350 kW. Due to the size and weight constraint, the parabolic antenna of radars for fixed aircraft is replaced by a 72-inch x 12 inch slotted planar array antenna for AN/APS-124, and scan rate is 6 or 12 rpm, with 120 rpm for weather. The array of AN/APS-124 produces a 1.2 x 20 degrees beam, and the typical range against a 1 square meter target is 16 nm in comparison to 20 nm of AN/APS-115/116. AN/APS-124 is installed on Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk.

usn_spy_1a=AN/SPY-1A=The AN/SPY-1A is a multi-function, phased array, 3D air search radar that provides search, detection, tracking, and discrimination data of air and surface targets. It is the main fire control radar for the Aegis Combat System, which equiped on early Aegis ships
usn_spy_1d=AN/SPY-1D=The AN/SPY-1D was first installed on USS Arleigh Burke in 1991, with all antenna in a single deckhouse. It is a variant of the -1B to fit the Arleigh Burke class using the UYK-43 computer, with the main antenna also used as missile uplinks, thus eliminate the need of separate missile uplink in earlier models, and the UYA-4 display in earlier models is replaced by UYQ-21 display.
